 == OPEN TASKS ==
-Synchronize code (for eg. component write/read...)
-Optimize Exception::what() [strings]
-Check if any casts are causing any problems
-Think about having events only on SD card (not in RAM) and reading each event from file upon checking (yes, it will be slower but maybe not that much?)

 == FEATURES ==
-Evaluate LDR lux unit conversion function
-Support command execution in events (possibly a good solution is to save the command as a task in a file associated with the event and read it upon raise/expire, parse and execute)
-Rework sleeping! This shit just can't get fixed...

 == MAINTENANCE ==
-Reorganize code (good portion of code can probably go to amanda.core or even amanda.concepts; also create amanda.platform shared project and put everything from amanda.device except .inos there if possible)

 == TRIAGE ==
-HTTPClient::respond(double), maybe support 'int base' as well (check how it is done on other streams, because they by default take 2)
-Check RequestBodyParser in server/request.cpp, and rethink if there is another solution to the action naming problem (the name after the colon, eg: <action process="Event/create:my-ev">...); currently the 'problem' is 'void RequestBodyParser::attribute_spec_end()', line with 'String64 name = action_name;' (119 at the moment), name must be copied for later use... Avoid copying somehow?
-Create another thread which polls events (in that case, that thread and server thread [loop] need synchronization)
-Maybe implement xor-doubly linked vlist?
-Somehow optimize HardwareController::find() [unimportant]
-Somehow support real-time server notifications instead of polling the server?
